# A Review of Metasurfaces: Principles and Applications
A self-contained review of optical metasurfaces covering theoretical foundations, design frameworks, and applications in imaging, holography, and sensing.

**Abstract**: 
The miniaturization of optical systems is currently limited by the volumetric nature of refractive
lenses. Metasurfaces overcome this barrier by encoding optical functionality into ultrathin, subwave-
length arrays. This review establishes the theoretical foundations of flat optics, contrasting
classical phase accumulation with the generalized laws of refraction and scalar diffraction theory.
We then detail a hierarchical design framework, moving from the physics of meta-atom scattering to
system-level optimization. Key applications are surveyed, including compact imaging, holographic
displays, and polarization sensing. Finally, we discuss critical bottlenecks in efficiency and band-
width, highlighting the emerging role of data-driven design. Ultimately, these advances position
metasurfaces as a scalable, industrial-grade technology set to revolutionaize consumer products and
the optical research frontier.
